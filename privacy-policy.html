                <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Pact Split (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Isidro Pascual. The Application is a bill-splitting tool that uses optical character recognition (“OCR”) to parse a photograph of a printed receipt into a list of selectable items and enables the division of the total amount owed among multiple people.</p>
                
                <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
                
                <h3>User Provided Information:</h3>
                <p>The Application obtains the information you provide when you download and use the Application, including, but not limited to, photographs taken using the Application’s camera feature or imported from the device, the contents of receipts entered or parsed via OCR, names entered and receipt items selected.</p>
                
                <h3>Automatically Collected Information:</h3>
                <p>In addition, the Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, and information about the way you use the Application.</p>
                
                <h2>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h2>
                <p>The Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>
                
                <h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h2>
                <p>For the purpose of parsing receipt photographs into text, we send the receipt images you take with the Application to an OCR services provider. We send only the image file itself with no additional information. However, anything visible in the photo or any metadata in the image file will be visible to our OCR services provider and is subject to their privacy policy.</p>
                <p>With the exception of receipt images, as described above, only aggregated, anonymized data may be transmitted to external services to help us improve the Application and our service. We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>

                    <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h2>What are my opt-out rights?</h2>
                <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application by uninstalling the Application, using the standard uninstall processes available on your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>
                
                <h2>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>
